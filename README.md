# Tic Tac Toe

An implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe in React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

Notice how the entire game state and logic is contained in a separate module that exports a custom hook.

The row and column components are not only used to display the game board, which is 1 column ('gap-0') with 3 rows ('gap-0') that each contain 3 squares, but also to display the entire UI ('gap-20').
